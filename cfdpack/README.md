run:
  mesh partitioner:
    $cd bin/pgmsh/
    $mpirun -n 4 ./pgmsh ../../cas/cavity_2d/cavity_2d.ctrl

  CFD solver:
    $cd bin/psolv/
    $mpirun -n 4 ./psolv ../../cas/cavity_2d/cavity_2d.ctrl

--- or for a serial run ---

  mesh partitioner:
    $cd bin/pgmsh/
    $./pgmsh ../../cas/cavity_2d/cavity_2d.ctrl

  CFD solver:
    $cd bin/psolv/
    $./psolv ../../cas/cavity_2d/cavity_2d.ctrl


post-process:
  $cd ../../cas/cavity_2d
  $gmsh cavity_2d.geo cavity_2d.msh_p* spd.msh_p* pres.msh_p*


KNOWN ISSUES:
  If a mesh is not generated by Gmsh, but rather converted to Gmsh, e.g. by Hip,
  that mesh may need to be preprocessed serially by pgmsh before being partitioned.
  This may be required because at present psolv assumes the elements in the gmsh file
  are ordered according to boundary elements then domain elements.
